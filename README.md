Web Scraping(Text)

Web scraping is a technique using which the webpages from the internet are fetched and parsed to understand and extract specific information similar to a human being. Web scrapping consists of two parts:
•	Web Crawling Accessing the webpages over the internet and pulling data from them.
•	HTML Parsing Parsing the HTML content of the webpages obtained through web crawling and then extracting specific information from it.
Hence, web scrappers are applications/bots, which automatically send requests to websites and then extract the desired information from the website output.

Examples of the applications of web scrapping are:
•	Competitive pricing.
•	Manufacturers monitor the market, whether the retailer is maintaining a minimum price or not.
•	Sentiment analysis of the consumers, whether they are happy with the services and products or not.
•	To aggregate news articles.
•	To aggregate Marketing data.
•	To gain financial insights from the market.
•	To gather data for research.
•	To generate marketing leads.
•	To collect trending topics by media houses.
And, the list goes on
